  </ul>

  <h2>✨ Key Features & Insights 🔍</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>📌 Holistic View:</strong> The dashboard presents key performance indicators (KPIs) at a glance, including total sales 💵 ($1.2M), number of items 📦 (8,523), and average rating ⭐ (3.9).</li>
    <li><strong>⚙️ Interactive Filtering:</strong> A dynamic filter panel allows users to slice the data by <strong>Outlet Size</strong> (High, Medium, Small), <strong>Outlet Location Type</strong> (Tier 1, 2, 3), and <strong>Item Type</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>🔎 Detailed Analysis:</strong>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>🏬 Performance by Outlet:</strong> Charts break down sales by outlet size and location, revealing that Tier 3 locations have the highest sales.</li>
        <li><strong>🥗 Item Performance:</strong> A breakdown of sales by item type and an analysis of products based on "Fat Content" (Low-Fat vs. Regular).</li>

  <h2>✨ Recommendations & Actionable Insights 🚀</h2>
  <p>Based on the data, the analysis concluded with actionable recommendations to drive business growth:</p>
